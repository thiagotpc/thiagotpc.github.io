                    <p property="abstract">This article presents an extended Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) focused on usability and user experience (UX)  valuation technologies for Touchable Holographic Solutions (THS). Given the growing integration of holograms in Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) settings, evaluating usability and UX becomes highly important. Our study expands on previous research by analyzing an additional two years of publications, covering 5429 studies, and selecting 65 that discuss 200 evaluation technologies. The main problem addressed is the gap in comprehensive evaluation frameworks that integrate usability and UX criteria. We followed systematic guidelines to identify and analyze evaluation technologies, highlighting an increased focus on UX alongside traditional usability. Key findings include the persistent emphasis on time efficiency in usability evaluations and the dominance of generic UX, usability, and pleasure/fun in UX assessments. However, unique aspects of MR, such as presence, are often overlooked. The study also reveals a preference for empirical validation through controlled experiments and case studies, although few technologies have undergone such validation. Head-mounted displays (HMDs) and smart glasses, especially Microsoft Hololens™, remain prevalent due to their advanced capabilities. Our findings underscore the need for integrated evaluation technologies and empirical validation to ensure reliability. This work contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) area by mapping current evaluation technologies, identifying research gaps, and providing a foundation for developing innovative and effective evaluation methods for THS, thus advancing the understanding and improvement of user interaction in immersive environments.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">Touchable Holographic Solutions (THS) are an application type in Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR/MR) environments. Evaluating THS requires considering Usability and User eXperience (UX), particularly Immersion and Presence, often overlooked by current methods. A systematic mapping study and exploratory search revealed gaps, such as the lack of a unified instrument for THS usability and UX evaluation, methods that address THS-specific aspects, and challenges in adapting general evaluation technologies. To bridge these gaps, we present the Usability and User Experience Evaluation in Touchable Holograms (UUXE-ToH) questionnaire, with 67 Likert scale items and three open-ended questions. A validation study with 13 experts provided quantitative data and qualitative feedback. Results confirm the UUXE-ToH’s efficacy and offer insights for improvement. This research contributes to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by introducing a validated tool for evaluating THS, integrating hedonic and pragmatic aspects, and supporting early problem identification in development, accessible to professionals with diverse UX expertise.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">This study investigates the usability, user experience (UX), and playability of a mixed reality (MR) game called Cubism, which allows participants to interact with holograms using hand gestures. We conducted an experiment with seven participants to evaluate their interaction with the game. The Usability and User Experience Evaluation in Touchable Hologram (UUXE-ToH) questionnaire was the primary data collection instrument to capture participants’ perceptions of usability, satisfaction, and overall experience. Our findings indicate that the mixed reality environment of Cubism offers an engaging and intuitive user experience, though several challenges were identified. These insights contribute to the growing body of knowledge on human-computer interaction in mixed-reality contexts and suggest avenues for improving the design of future mixed-reality games. This research is valuable to the VR/AR/MR community by highlighting the critical factors influencing user interaction and satisfaction in MR games.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">Augmented and Mixed Reality enables applications where users engage in natural hand interactions, simulating touch, termed touchable holography solutions (THS). These applications are achievable through head-mounted displays and are helpful in training, equipment control, and entertainment. Usability and User eXperience (UX) evaluations are crucial for ensuring the quality and appropriateness of THS, yet many are assessed using non-specific technologies. The UUXE-ToH questionnaire was proposed and subjected to expert study for content and face validity to address this gap. This study enhances questionnaire credibility and acceptance by identifying clarity issues, aligning questions with study theory, and reducing author-induced bias, offering an effective and cost-efficient approach. The study garnered numerous contributions that were analyzed qualitatively and processed to refine the questionnaire. This paper introduces the UUXE-ToH in its initial version, details expert feedback an alysis, outlines the methodology for incorporating suggestions, and presents the enhanced version, UUXE-ToH v2. This evidence-based process contributes to a better understanding of usability and UX evaluation in the THS context. UUXE-ToH can impact the quality of life of users of solutions applied to education, health, and entertainment by helping develop better products.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">Interacting with holograms using the hands is on track to reach a
                        broad audience in the coming years. Therefore, a current challenge
                        is understanding how to evaluate this new interaction scenario concerning Usability and User eXperience (UX). In this use context, the
                        user interacts with virtual objects in your real environment. Some
                        already known evaluation technologies have been applied to this
                        type of solution, although they were not created considering aspects
                        such as immersion and presence, typical in this interactive environment. Thus, this paper presents a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)
                        that sought to identify usability and UX evaluation technologies
                        applied to touchable holographic solutions in augmented reality
                        or mixed reality environments. Furthermore, the SMS sought to
                        answer questions about evaluation technologies and holographic
                        solutions. The SMS examined 3551 publications and selected 40 that
                        presented 106 usability or UX evaluation technologies in a touchable holographic solution. The results shed light on methods and
                        aspects little addressed and showed patterns and preferences for
                        combinations of devices, gestures, and feedback types. This work
                        contributes to HCI researchers by better understanding the state
                        of the art of usability and UX evaluation technologies applied to
                        touchable holographic solutions, classifying them, and discussing
                        the main gaps and opportunities.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) or Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) are a process in
                        which
                        publications dataset is systematically analyzed to cover a research field. These processes
                        involve
                        multiple investigators collaborating to produce more improved work and often use automated tools
                        to
                        facilitate their work. Problem: However, not all tools offer proper support to collaborative SLR
                        or SMS.
                        That is, missing a tool to support the study selection process, allowing the collaboration
                        between
                        researchers by applying individual criteria and collective decision, supported by agreement or
                        discussion and consensus. Solution: We developed the Porifera tool to fill this lack. IS Theory:
                        Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a Grounded Theory's phase subset were used to evaluate
                        Porifera's
                        tool quality. Methodology: Undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in the Experimental
                        Software
                        Engineering Research, used the Porifera tool and answered a post-used questionnaire with TAM's
                        sentences
                        and other open questions. Then, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Summary
                        of
                        Results: It was possible to see high perceived usefulness and ease of use for Porifera. Too it
                        noted the
                        effectiveness of resources to support the collaborative activity and its contribution to
                        learning and
                        performing a collaborative SLR or SMS. The evaluation showed points to improve the Porifera's
                        interface.
                        Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The Porifera is an IS for data, information, and
                        knowledge
                        research management because it gathers publications records and allows it will be interpreted
                        and
                        processed, making possible decisions making by researchers. The Porifera also allows performing
                        an SLR
                        or SMS with mobility, knowledge sharing, flexibility, and integration between people and
                        technology.</p>

                    <p property="abstract">This paper describes a study on the phenomenon of exploratory research on the Web. As a result,
                        we present a framework to support this type of information seeking with six dimensions: quality,
                        presentation, time, cognition and knowledge acquisition, personalization and collaboration. We
                        also present a tool that brings a new way to view the search history with features to organize
                        research projects. This tool aims to test some aspects of these dimensions, being based on a server and a
                        browser extension model. The experiments done showed results that demonstrate a good acceptability of
                        the features introduced.</p>

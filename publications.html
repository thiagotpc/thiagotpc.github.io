                    <p property="abstract">Interacting with holograms using the hands is on track to reach a
                        broad audience in the coming years. Therefore, a current challenge
                        is understanding how to evaluate this new interaction scenario concerning Usability and User eXperience (UX). In this use context, the
                        user interacts with virtual objects in your real environment. Some
                        already known evaluation technologies have been applied to this
                        type of solution, although they were not created considering aspects
                        such as immersion and presence, typical in this interactive environment. Thus, this paper presents a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS)
                        that sought to identify usability and UX evaluation technologies
                        applied to touchable holographic solutions in augmented reality
                        or mixed reality environments. Furthermore, the SMS sought to
                        answer questions about evaluation technologies and holographic
                        solutions. The SMS examined 3551 publications and selected 40 that
                        presented 106 usability or UX evaluation technologies in a touchable holographic solution. The results shed light on methods and
                        aspects little addressed and showed patterns and preferences for
                        combinations of devices, gestures, and feedback types. This work
                        contributes to HCI researchers by better understanding the state
                        of the art of usability and UX evaluation technologies applied to
                        touchable holographic solutions, classifying them, and discussing
                        the main gaps and opportunities.</p>

                    <p>This paper presents Porifera, a collaborative tool to support Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
                        and
                        Systematic Mapping Study (SMS). The tool allows the creation of a project for a researchers
                        team. The
                        user defines the goal, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting primary studies, the
                        search
                        string, and the digital libraries. Also, the tool imports publications and identifies
                        duplicates. The
                        selection process occurs with the individual application of criteria and resolution of
                        disagreements.
                        During the process, it is possible to observe the agreement and reliability of the researchers'
                        evaluations. Porifera works on a web platform and integrates external services for translation,
                        reference citation, and linking publications' files. Porifera's use can improve review and
                        selection
                        processes, optimize time, and prevent errors while facilitating collaboration between

                    </p>
                    <p>Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) or Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) are a process in
                        which
                        publications dataset is systematically analyzed to cover a research field. These processes
                        involve
                        multiple investigators collaborating to produce more improved work and often use automated tools
                        to
                        facilitate their work. Problem: However, not all tools offer proper support to collaborative SLR
                        or SMS.
                        That is, missing a tool to support the study selection process, allowing the collaboration
                        between
                        researchers by applying individual criteria and collective decision, supported by agreement or
                        discussion and consensus. Solution: We developed the Porifera tool to fill this lack. IS Theory:
                        Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a Grounded Theory's phase subset were used to evaluate
                        Porifera's
                        tool quality. Methodology: Undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in the Experimental
                        Software
                        Engineering Research, used the Porifera tool and answered a post-used questionnaire with TAM's
                        sentences
                        and other open questions. Then, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Summary
                        of
                        Results: It was possible to see high perceived usefulness and ease of use for Porifera. Too it
                        noted the
                        effectiveness of resources to support the collaborative activity and its contribution to
                        learning and
                        performing a collaborative SLR or SMS. The evaluation showed points to improve the Porifera's
                        interface.
                        Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The Porifera is an IS for data, information, and
                        knowledge
                        research management because it gathers publications records and allows it will be interpreted
                        and
                        processed, making possible decisions making by researchers. The Porifera also allows performing
                        an SLR
                        or SMS with mobility, knowledge sharing, flexibility, and integration between people and
                        technology.</p>

                    <p>This paper describes a study on the phenomenon of exploratory research on the Web. As a result,
                        we
                        present a framework to support this type of information seeking with six dimensions: quality,
                        presentation, time, cognition and knowledge acquisition, personalization and collaboration. We
                        also
                        present a tool that brings a new way to view the search history with features to organize

                        projects. This tool aims to test some aspects of these dimensions, being based on a server and a
                        browser
                        extension model. The experiments done showed results that demonstrate a good acceptability of

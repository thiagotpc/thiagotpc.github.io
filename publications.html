                tool, which supports
                Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) processes. The study revealed a
                high perceived usefulness and ease of use of the tool and identified points for improving the interface,
                such as user feedback and error prevention. The quantitative and qualitative results suggest that
                Porifera is a valuable tool for learning and performing collaborative SLR and SMS. Additionally, the

            <p>This paper presents Porifera, a collaborative tool to support Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and
                Systematic Mapping Study (SMS). The tool allows the creation of a project for a researchers team. The
                user defines the goal, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting primary studies, the search
                string, and the digital libraries. Also, the tool imports publications and identifies duplicates. The
                selection process occurs with the individual application of criteria and resolution of disagreements.
                During the process, it is possible to observe the agreement and reliability of the researchers’
                evaluations. Porifera works on a web platform and integrates external services for translation,
                reference citation, and linking publications’ files. Porifera’s use can improve review and selection
                processes, optimize time, and prevent errors while facilitating collaboration between researchers.</p>

            <p>Context: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) or Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) are a process in which
                publications dataset is systematically analyzed to cover a research field. These processes involve
                multiple investigators collaborating to produce more improved work and often use automated tools to
                facilitate their work. Problem: However, not all tools offer proper support to collaborative SLR or SMS.
                That is, missing a tool to support the study selection process, allowing the collaboration between
                researchers by applying individual criteria and collective decision, supported by agreement or
                discussion and consensus. Solution: We developed the Porifera tool to fill this lack. IS Theory:
                Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and a Grounded Theory’s phase subset were used to evaluate Porifera’s
                tool quality. Methodology: Undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in the Experimental Software
                Engineering Research, used the Porifera tool and answered a post-used questionnaire with TAM’s sentences
                and other open questions. Then, a quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed. Summary of
                Results: It was possible to see high perceived usefulness and ease of use for Porifera. Too it noted the
                effectiveness of resources to support the collaborative activity and its contribution to learning and
                performing a collaborative SLR or SMS. The evaluation showed points to improve the Porifera’s interface.
                Contribution and Impact in the IS area: The Porifera is an IS for data, information, and knowledge
                research management because it gathers publications records and allows it will be interpreted and
                processed, making possible decisions making by researchers. The Porifera also allows performing an SLR
                or SMS with mobility, knowledge sharing, flexibility, and integration between people and technology.</p>

            <p>This paper describes a study on the phenomenon of exploratory research on the Web. As a result, we
                present a framework to support this type of information seeking with six dimensions: quality,
                presentation, time, cognition and knowledge acquisition, personalization and collaboration. We also
                present a tool that brings a new way to view the search history with features to organize research
                projects. This tool aims to test some aspects of these dimensions, being based on a server and a browser
                extension model. The experiments done showed results that demonstrate a good acceptability of the
                features introduced.</p>
